# Legendary Game Launcher

A simple c++ console application to launch games installed with [Legendary](https://github.com/derrod/legendary)

### Why?

- Legendary games must be launched with a console command or bat file, I wanted a better solution, and one that I could add game icons to.
   - This allows for quicker launch times, and no more fumbling with console commands and app ID's

### Usage:
- This app is very simple, it has two CLI arguments, `--help` and `--game`
  - `--game` allows you to set the Epic ID of the game you want to launch
  - `--help` is pretty self explanatory
